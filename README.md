# RizzyPrompts

This is a modern Next.js 13 full-stack application called RizzyPrompts. It allows users to share and create AI prompts with other users. The project is built to showcase the benefits of Next.js over using React alone and to explore its newest features. RizzyPrompts also leverages Tailwind CSS for styling.

## Features

- **AI Prompts:** Users can create and share AI prompts with other users.
- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR):** Next.js provides faster initial page load times by rendering the page on the server and sending HTML to the client. This improves performance compared to React, which sends JavaScript and HTML to be rendered on the client-side in the browser.
- **Improved SEO:** Next.js's SSR capabilities enable search engines to easily crawl and index the content, enhancing SEO and improving the visibility and ranking of your website.
- **Efficient Code Splitting:** Next.js automatically splits code based on page boundaries, resulting in smaller initial bundles and faster page transitions.
- **Simplified Routing:** Next.js offers a file-based routing system, eliminating the need for additional routing libraries like react-router. This simplifies routing and allows developers to focus on building the application logic.
- **Automatic TypeScript Support:** Next.js has excellent built-in TypeScript support, enabling the development of type-safe applications with fewer errors and improved code quality.
- **Tailwind CSS:** RizzyPrompts utilizes Tailwind CSS for efficient and customizable styling. Tailwind CSS offers a utility-first approach, allowing for rapid UI development.
- **Built-in API Routes:** Next.js provides API routes, allowing developers to create serverless functions within the same project. This simplifies backend development and enables seamless communication between the frontend and backend.
